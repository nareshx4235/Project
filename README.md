# Face Authentication Based Attendance System
Welcome to the Face Authentication Based Attendance System project.
This project aims to provide an innovative solution for attendance tracking using facial recognition technology.

# Project Overview
The Face Authentication Based Attendance System is developed using **Python** and **OpenCV**. 
It leverages the **Haar Cascade algorithm** for facial detection and the **LBPH algorithm** for facial recognition.

# Technologies Used
1. **Python**
2. **OpenCV**
3. **MySQL**
4. **Haar Cascade algorithm**
5. **Tkinter**
6. **LBPH algorithm**

# Key Features
1. **Check-in and Checkout Time:**  Automatically records check-in and checkout times for attendance tracking.

2. **Attendance Data Excel Export:** Generates an Excel file containing attendance data for easy management and analysis.

3. **Monthly Record Generation:** Creates a monthly record for each individual, including the total number of present days, average check-in, and checkout time.

4. **Accurate Facial Detection and Recognition:** Utilizes advanced algorithms for precise facial detection and recognition.

5. **Automated Attendance Tracking:** Streamlines the attendance tracking process with automated functionalities.

6. **User-friendly Interface:** Designed with a user-friendly interface using Tkinter for easy navigation and usage.
